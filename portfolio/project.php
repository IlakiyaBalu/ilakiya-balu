 <p style="font-size: 18px;line-height: 30px;">College placement cell is an important component of any college. The final year students appear for interviews offered by various companies invited by the placement officer. For this there is a need of an online system where the placement officer can post the upcoming placement drives. Students willing to appear for these placement drives must be able to register and get the message for any placement drive matching their qualification.This PHP web application Project is created as a sample project for students of computer science who are looking for their final semester projects.

<p style="color: blue;font-weight: bolder;padding: 10px;font-size: 30px;text-decoration: underline;" >Secure E-voting Using Adjusted Blockchain Technology</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;line-height: 30px;"> The blockchain based voting system using multichain platform can address this problem and provide a highly secure voting system. At the same time, it also allows voters the ability to vote directly from their homes with an access to a PC. The blockchain technology is computationally secure and cannot be easily tampered with. With today's systems, successfully hacking a blockchain network is near impossible. This system makes the election process very simple and robust while at the same time saving a lot of resources. There is however an overhead of time associated with blockchain transactions. But that is a small price for a highly secure voting system.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;line-height: 30px;font-family: cursive;background-color: gray;padding: 15px; ">Blockchain.com is a cryptocurrency blockchain explorer service, as well as a cryptocurrency wallet and a cryptocurrency exchange supporting Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum. They also provide Bitcoin data charts, stats, and market information.<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp">To Know more</a>about Blockchain.</p>
<p style="font-size: 28px;color: green;font-weight: bold;">Reason Why we want?</p>
 <p style="line-height: 30px;font-size: 18px;">To avoid this, if system is integrated with blockchain- a special property called immutability protects system. Consider SQL, PHP, or any other traditional database systems. You can insert, update, or delete votes. But in a blockchain you can just insert data but cannot update or delete. Hence when you insert something, it stays there forever and no one can manipulate it- Thus name immutable ledger.

But Building a blockchain system is not enough. It should be decentralized i.e if one server goes down or something happens on a particular node, other nodes can function normally and do not have to wait for victim nodeâ€™s recovery.To Know more<a href="projectdoc.pdf">Open PDF File here.</a></p>
